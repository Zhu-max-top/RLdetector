# RLdetector
This is the source code of a lane recognition program based on traditional visual analysis. By using image processing, edge detection, ROI region pre setting, Hough transform and other operations, high robustness recognition results are fed back.
The code is concise and effective. Allow for higher accuracy recognition through SCNN deep models. This solution is a good foundation framework for lane recognition programs, and users can develop more accurate code based on it.
